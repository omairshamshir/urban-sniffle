# Amazon Promotions Discord Bot

## Overview

This Discord bot monitors Amazon product searches for promotions and notifies users in designated Discord channels. It
uses web scraping techniques to find products with active promotions and filters them based on monthly sales data.

## Features

- Automated Amazon product searches
- Promotion notifications in Discord channels
- Customizable search terms
- Multiple notification channels support
- Minimum monthly sales cutoff filter

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up your Discord bot and get the token
4. Configure the bot token & mongo uri in `.env` and other settings in `config.py`
5. Run the bot: `python main.py`

## Running on EC2

To run the bot on an EC2 instance:

1. SSH into your EC2 instance
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd promo-scraper`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install Xvfb if not already installed: `sudo apt-get install xvfb`
5. Run the bot using Xvfb: `xvfb-run -a python3 main.py`

Note: Using `xvfb-run` allows the bot to run in a virtual framebuffer, which is necessary for headless environments like EC2 instances.
